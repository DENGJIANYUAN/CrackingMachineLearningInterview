## CrackingMachineLearningInterview

These questions are guranteed to be asked in Machine Learning Engineer or ML based interviews for upto 80% of your job interviews. Make sure that you cover and know about machine learning. These questions can Ace your interviews regarding ML even if you are a fresh graduate or upto 5 years of experience.

## Questions

#### Difference between SuperVised and Unsupervised Learning?
        Supervised learning is when you know the outcome and you are provided with the fully labeled outcome data while in unsupervised you are not provided with labeled outcome data. Fully labeled means that each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer the algorithm should come up with on its own. So, a labeled dataset of flower images would tell the model which photos were of roses, daisies and daffodils. When shown a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label.
#### What is Reinforcment Learning and how would you define it?
        A learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) .Semisupervised learning is also known as Reinforcment learning, in reinforcment learning each learning steps involved a penalty criteria whether to give model positive points or negative points and based on that penalizing the model.

#### What is Randomforest and Decision Trees?	
#### How does RandomForest Works and Decition Trees?	
#### What is Gini Index? Explain the concept?
        The Gini Index is calculated by subtracting the sum of the squared probabilities of each class from one. It favors larger partitions.
        Imagine, you want to draw a decision tree and wants to decide which feature/column you should use for your first split?, this is probably defined
        by your gini index.
#### What is the process of gini index calculation?
        Gini Index:
        for each branch in split:
            Calculate percent branch represents #Used for weighting
            for each class in branch:
                Calculate probability of class in the given branch.
                Square the class probability.
            Sum the squared class probabilities.
            Subtract the sum from 1. #This is the Ginin Index for branch
        Weight each branch based on the baseline probability.
        Sum the weighted gini index for each split.
